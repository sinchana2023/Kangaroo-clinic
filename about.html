    <div class="slideshow"></div>

    <div class="sticky"><h3 style="color: white;text-align: center;">Our Services</h3> </div>
    
    <h3>Medicines</h3>
    <p>medical and health care services provided to a Person, including, but not limited to, medical and health care services provided to a Person which are covered by a policy of insurance, and includes, without limitation, physician services, nurse and
        therapist services, dental services, hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation services, home health care services, residential and out-patient behavioral healthcare services, and medicine or
        health care equipment provided to a Person for a necessary or specifically requested valid and proper medical or health purpose.</p>
    <h3>Asthma</h3>
    <p>Asthma is a long-term condition affecting children and adults. The air passages in the lungs become narrow due to inflammation and tightening of the muscles around the small airways. This causes asthma symptoms such as cough, wheeze, shortness of
        breath and chest tightness. These symptoms are intermittent and are often worse at night or during exercise. Other common triggers can make asthma symptoms worse. Triggers vary from person to person, but can include viral infections (colds), dust,
        smoke, fumes, changes in the weather, grass and tree pollen, animal fur and feathers, strong soaps and perfume.</p>
    <h3>Allergies</h3>
    <div style="float: right;"><img src="newborn.jpeg"></div>
    <p>Allergies in children are those causes, pathophysiology, treatments, management, practices and control of allergies that develop in children.[1] [2] Up to 40 percent of children suffer from allergic rhinitis. And children are more likely to develop
        allergies if one or both parents have allergies.Allergies differ between adults and children. Part of the reason for the difference is that the respiratory system in children is smaller. The bronchi and bronchioles are narrower so even a slight
        decrease in diameter of these airways can have serious consequences. Many children outgrow their allergies.</p>
    <h3>New born</h3>
    <p>Newborn care specialists are called upon to help new parents care for their newborns. Newborn care specialists typically come into the home for several weeks after a child is born and help the parents develop healthy eating, sleeping and care routines.
        Many newborn care specialists function as parent educators, teaching parenting proper and accepted baby care techniques. Newborn care specialists typically work 8 to 24 hour shifts and are responsible for all the tasks related to the baby’s care,
        including bottle preparation (if needed), baby laundry and nursery organization.</p>
    <h3>Nutrition</h3>
    <p>Educational requirements for becoming a pediatric nutritionist are more involved than the process of becoming a nutritionist that is without a specialization. Because a pediatric nutritionist deals with children, there is a greater focus on education
        throughout the country. To become a pediatric nutritionist, individuals must earn a Bachelor’s Degree in Nutrition or Dietetics. This education is also expected to incorporate coursework that is specific to the guidelines set by the Accreditation
        Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND). Most colleges and universities incorporate the necessary coursework into their respective curriculums. This means that students will learn material that has been approved by ACEND.</p>
    <h3>Sports/Physicals</h3>
    <p>A sports physical can help athletes find out about and deal with health problems that might interfere with their participation in a sport. For example, for a kid who has frequent asthma attacks but is a starting forward in soccer, a doctor might be
        able to prescribe a different type of inhaler or adjust the dosage for easier breathing during running. The doctor may even have some good training tips and be able to give athletes some ideas for avoiding injuries. For example, the doctor may
        recommend certain stretching or strengthening activities, that help prevent injuries. A doctor also can identify risk factors that are linked to specific sports. Advice like this will make kids better, stronger athletes.</p>
    
        <div class="sticky"><h3 style="color: white;text-align: center;">Our Values </h3> </div>  

    <h3><img src="1bscntgj.png" height="35px" width="35px"> Patient Centricity</h3>
    <p>Commit to ‘best outcomes and experience’ for our patients Treat patients and their caregivers with compassion, care Our patients’ needs will come first and Creating a patient-centric solution involves getting feedback from patients themselves and
        making decisions based on their needs and perspectives. The term can mean different things to different people.A key aspect of developing a patient-centric clinical trial is trust between the patients and clinical trial members. Building credibility
        can be achieved through clear communication, providing patients with thorough information regarding the clinical study, and ensuring the patient understands the participating risk to benefit ratio. </p>
    <h3> <img src="v89qhaug.png" height="35px" width="35px">Integrity</h3>
    <p>Be principled, open and honest Model and live our ‘Values’ Demonstrate moral courage to speak up and do the right things,, “A virtue consisting of soundness of and adherence to moral principles and character and standing up in their defense when they
        are threatened or under attack. This involves consistent, habitual honesty and a coherent integration of reasonably stable, justifiable moral values, with consistent judgment and action over time” (Miller-Keane & O'Toole, 2003). In healthcare
        settings we can define integrity as encompassing honesty, keeping one's word, and consistently adhering to principles of professionalism, even when it is not easy to do so. Accountability usually refers to reliability and answering to those who
        trust us, including our patients, colleagues, and society in general. Dr. Porter demonstrated these attributes when he took responsibility for the error, corrected it, and apologized to the patient.</p>
    <h3><img src="xmlrc5o4.png" height="35px" width="35px"> Teamwork</h3>
    <p>Proactively support each other and operate as one team Respect and value people at all levels with different opinions, experiences and backgrounds Demonstrate moral courage to speak up and do the right things, Hospitals with high teamwork ratings
        experience higher patient satisfaction, higher nurse retention, and lower hospital costs. Elements of effective teamwork have been defined and provide a framework for assessment and improvement efforts in hospitals. Measurement of teamwork is
        essential to understand baseline performance, and to demonstrate the utility of resources invested to enhance it and the subsequent impact on patient care. Interventions designed to improve teamwork in hospitals include localization of physicians,
        daily goals of care forms and checklists, teamwork training, and interdisciplinary rounds. Though additional research is needed to evaluate the impact on patient outcomes, these interventions consistently result in improved teamwork knowledge,
        ratings of teamwork climate, and better understanding of patients' plans of care. The optimal approach is implementation of a combination of interventions, with adaptations to fit unique clinical settings and local culture.</p>
    <h3><img src="ycsna6uy.png" height="35px" width="35px"> Ownership</h3>
    <p>Be responsible and take pride in our actions Take initiative and go beyond the call of duty Deliver commitment and agreement made. In the face of increasing health care costs, taxing not-for-profit hospitals may be seen as the right choice to increase
        government revenues if not-for-profit hospitals are not different from their for-profit counterparts. This study investigates how hospital ownership type affects treatment choices to show whether ownership type and teaching status are correlated
        with choosing a procedure as the treatment and how these choices relate to patient insurance type. Not-for-profit hospitals significantly differ from for-profits in terms of treatment choices of less profitable patients and all hospitals are more
        likely to accord the procedure when the patient is privately insured than uninsured though teaching government hospitals are the most likely to accord the procedures for all insurance types.</p>
    <h3><img src="vqtb2dx7.png" height="35px" width="35px"> Innovation</h3>
    <p>Continuously improve and innovate to exceed expectations Adopt a ‘can-do’ attitude Challenge ourselves to do things differently. Through the digitization of healthcare, patient experience and outcome can be improved – but digital technologies also
        impact the entirety of healthcare provision. From virtual methods for HCP-to-HCP communication to digital platforms for performing administrative tasks such as updating patient records and data, the potential benefits of new, disruptive and exciting
        technologies impact throughout a whole hospital organization. As such, benefits in terms of efficiency, ease-of-use, time-savings and cost reductions can be felt by all those who work in the sector, from hospital management through to practicing
        clinicians.
